TODO:

- Usability improvements
    - Detect quality value encoding
    - Detect max read length
    - Detect convergence (instead of -n)
    - Add "keep intermediary files"
    - Test file permissions at start
    - rename emirge_amplicon to emirge (or emirge2?)
    - don't show date in log messages (just makes it long)
    - default DIR to cwd/EMIRGE2_runXXX_<timestamp>
    - write parameters to DIR
    - create symlinks to input data in DIR?
    - allow for "advanced" options not shown with --help
    - support single file for read pairs
    - use TRAVIS mascots

- File cleanup
    - compress sam/bam to cram if available?
    - check naming/places

- Janitoring
    - check/add docstrings
    - remove side effects of methods/functions
    - remove redirections (load cython methods into EM class?)
    - document all EM class properties

- Output refinement
    - do chimera check?
    - check for repeated regions?

- Detect convergence
    - show number of nucs changed
    - (calc overall likelihood?)

- Algorithmic
    - make num-matches-reported (-k) for initial/subsequent runs
      configurable
    - deal with ACACACAC type reads
        - remove low complexity reads
        - mask low entropy regions from reference
            - trim if trailing
            - toss? if middle

- Speed
    - only re-do mapping on changed sequences.

- Mappers
    - catch BBMap Exceptions

- Errors to catch
    - guard against cons fasta having 0 sequences
      (currently leads to crash)

DONE:
